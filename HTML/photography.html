        <p>I'm pretty interested in photography and although I do not own a DSLR, I have quite a few good stuff to show you guys.
        Check them out!</p>

            <p class="story">For a start, let's look at this cutie.<br> Last year, my grandad passed away.
            We had rituals that lasted for two weeks and while we were there, my cousin and I would go on walks in
            just that one street for hours. Other times, we would go to the park at the end of the street. On a day like
            that, we saw this tiny little ball of cuteness and our hearts just couldn't handle it.<br>I'm sure yours can't
            either, just look at him!
          </p><hr>

          <img src="Images/pinkpoui.jpg" alt="pink poui" class=picswstory>
            <p class=story>This is a tree called Pink Poui (<i>Tabebuia rosea</i>). Where I live, this tree can be seen in full bloom
              in the months of February and March. Everytime I look at this tree, I am filled with joy. I associate this tree with happiness,
              a sense of familiarity with my hometown, and one of my really good friends from school. We bonded by gushing about how pretty
              this tree is, and how it reminds us of the Japanese Cherry Blossom. Pretty, isn't it?
            </p><hr>

            <img src="Images/yellow.jpg" alt="sunshine" class=picswstory>
              <p class=story>During my first year in college, I had band practice at 7.30 AM everyday. That's a time when no one's around,
                and it felt like I had the campus all to myself. Walking with music in my ears, watching the sunrays peeping through the branches
                of the trees, and watching these yellow flowers fall from the tree onto the ground always gave me a lot of peace, because as the
                day grows older, the flowers would become shrivelled and dirty from everyone stomping all over them :(
              </p><hr>

              <img src="Images/lilypads.jpg" alt="lilypads" class=picswstory>
                <p class=story>This was taken in a medical college that I visited for an inter-college cultural fest. The campus was
                <i>beautiful</i>. It was a 100-year old campus apparently, and all the buildings were made of stone. There were vines
                growing on some of the walls, there was so much greenery all over the place, and the hostels were a sight to behold. The
                  lounge of the girls' hostel looked like the Gryffindor common room. There was a garden in the campus, and that's where I found
                  this pond with lily pads! (as you can see by now, I love dogs and flowers hehe)</p><hr><br><br><br><br>
