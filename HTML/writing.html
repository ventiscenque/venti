          Writing is a beautiful form of expressing your thoughts.<br>
          It truly is a skill to be able to connect with people through your words, and through this blog or
          space that I have created for myself, I'm hoping to express myself in any form of art that I'm currently pursuing.<br>
          As a kid, I used to write poems, which weren't really that great but had good rhyme schemes, and in school, my
          articles and letters and stories were pretty darn good. So as you can see, I'm not big on writing. I don't have
          novels or anything big under my belt, but I like to think that my words certainly do have an impact.<br>
          So, I hope you can just read about my feelings. I hope it can give you a sense of comfort, reassurance, maybe it could
          cheer you up, or be a food for your thought, or maybe just amuse you. Whatever it is, I hope you enjoy!
